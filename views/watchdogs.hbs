      <h3>Watch Dogs 2 Gameplay:</h3>
      <p>Like its predecessor, Watch Dogs Second Edition is an action-based
        adventure game with many stealth elements and you can play this game
        from a third-person perspective as Marcus Holloway, who is a boy and a
        pirate. The game features an open world that takes place in a virtual
        version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area bordering both
        Chicagoland and Silicon Valley.
      </p>
      <p>The navigation of the players is easy and they can navigate the game
        world by walking or using different types of vehicles that are in the
        game like buses, trucks, motorcycles, boats, cars, cable cars, etc. so
        it is designed for great accessibility. The player must fire all the
        weapons while driving. Marcus is also shown improving his acrobatic
        skills and driving through the city.</p>
      <p>Another approach can be used by the players as an aggressive approach
        in which the players have to defeat their enemies with weapons
        consisting of a 3D printer and explosives such as mines or a melee
        weapon that Mark has, a billiard ball that remains attached. to the
        bungee cord. As an optional option, the player can also use a stealth
        approach in which they can avoid or temporarily paralyze enemies with
        Mark’s taser.</p>
